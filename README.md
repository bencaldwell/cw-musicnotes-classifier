# Music Notes Classifier

This is a toy project to demonstrate an ML workflow, by generating labelled sine waves that represent musical notes and training a model to classify them into a piano key. 
A pipeline is used to:
1. generate and label the sine waves
1. transform the sine waves ready for model training
1. train the model
1. validate the model
1. deploy the model
